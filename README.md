# Eniac-Magist_SQL_Business Analysis

## Project Overview

As a **Data Analyst at Eniac**, I conducted this project to evaluate a potential partnership with **Magist**, a Brazilian SaaS company specializing in order management solutions. **Eniac**, an e-commerce platform focusing on Apple-compatible accessories, is exploring expansion into the Brazilian market. This analysis focuses on assessing market compatibility, delivery performance, and sales trends to guide Eniac's strategic decision-making.


## Project Objective

To assess the feasibility of Eniac’s entry into Brazil through Magist’s platform by addressing **key business questions**:

- How does Magist's product portfolio align with Eniac’s focus on high-end tech products?
- What sales trends and performance insights can be derived for tech products?
- Are Magist’s delivery timelines sufficient to meet Eniac’s high standards for customer satisfaction?
- What risks, such as delayed deliveries, may impact customer trust?


## Key Responsibilities & approach

### Responsibilities:
  1. Perform data exploration using SQL to extract insights from nine datasets related to products, sellers, customers, orders, and deliveries.
  2. Design and develop interactive Tableau dashboards for effective data visualization.
  3. Present findings and actionable recommendations to stakeholders using Google Slides.

### Approach:
  - Extracted and analyzed product sales and category alignment with Eniac’s niche.
  - Evaluated delivery timelines, identifying potential risks related to delays.
  - Conducted a geolocation analysis to pinpoint high-potential regions for market entry.
  - Compared Magist’s performance metrics with Eniac’s standards to assess compatibility.


## Data Sources

The analysis uses data in CSV format provided by WBSCoding School, comprising the following datasets:

- **Product_category_name_translation**: Translations of product categories (Portuguese ↔ English).
- **Sellers**: Information on registered sellers in Magist's marketplace.
- **Customers**: Profiles of customers who made purchases.
- **Geo**: Geographical data (zip codes, coordinates, states).
- **Orders**: Details of orders, including multiple products per order ID.
- **Order_items**: Breakdown of individual items within each order.
- **Order_payments**: Customer payment data, including multiple payment methods.
- **Order_reviews**: Customer reviews and ratings for orders.


## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** Data exploration and analysis (MySQL Workbench)
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and interactive dashboards
- **Google Slides**: Presentation of findings


## Key Analysis Highlights

- **Product Alignment**: Tech products make up ~11% of Magist’s sales, with limited high-end options compared to Eniac’s portfolio.
- **Seller Insights**: ~ 15.4 % of Magist’s sellers focus on tech products.
- **Geolocation Trends**: São Paulo accounts for 60 % of total sales, making it a strong candidate for market entry.
- **Delivery Performance**:
  - National: 8.6 % of orders delivered within 3 days.
  - São Paulo: 87 % delivered within 3 days (comparable to Eniac’s standards).
- **Pricing**: Average tech product price is €120.65, below Eniac’s average of €540 for high-end products.


## Recommendations

1. **Pilot Launch in São Paulo**: Leverage São Paulo’s high sales volume and reliable delivery performance for a focused market entry.
2. **Optimize Delivery**: Collaborate with Magist to enhance delivery efficiency for lightweight, high-value products.
3. **Expand Tech Portfolio**: Partner with Magist to onboard more sellers offering premium tech products.
