# Eniac-Magist_SQL_Business Analysis

## Project Overview:

As a Data Analyst at Eniac, a growing online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, I analyzed e-commerce data to support a critical business decision regarding the company's potential expansion into the Brazilian market. To inform this decision, I explored data from Magist, a Brazilian Software as a Service company that provides a centralized order management system and after-sales services.

## Project Objective:

The goal was to utilize SQL and Tableau to assess the feasibility of partnering with Magist. Eniac had two main concerns:

  - Whether Magist is a suitable partner for high-end tech products, given Eniac’s exclusive focus on Apple-compatible accessories.
  - The adequacy of Magist's delivery times, as fast deliveries are essential for customer satisfaction.

## Key Business Questions

1. What categories of tech products does Magist offer, and how do they align with Eniac's product line?
2. How many products in these tech categories have been sold, and what percentage does this represent of overall sales?
3. What is the average delivery time for orders, and how does this compare to customer expectations?
4. Are there any patterns in delayed orders that could affect customer satisfaction?

## Key Responsibilities:

- Conducted data exploration using SQL to answer key business questions about product categories, sales performance, and order fulfillment.
- Developed interactive Tableau dashboards to visually present my findings to the board of directors, enabling informed decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Languages & Databases:**: SQL, MySQL
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau

## Expected Outcome

Delivered a comprehensive analysis of the potential partnership with Magist, guiding Eniac’s strategy for entering the Brazilian market while maintaining its customer-centric approach.
